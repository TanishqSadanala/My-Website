# My First Interview Experience in FAANG

I have only 10 months of experience, so I am a fresher. I got an interview at Amazon last month, and this is how it went.

## Interview Question

I was asked a question like this:

> Given a string of numbers "56, 65, 46, 38, 99, 88", sort the numbers in the string according to the sum of the digits of each 2-digit number in the given string of numbers.

Now, this is a pretty simple question. And I was not able to give a correct answer to this. I overshot it and used hashmaps to store the sum of each 2-digit number and failed at the end. (I tried to reverse index a hashmap ðŸ˜’ I did not know that it was not possible.)

At this point in the interview, I had solved like 50 LeetCode problems, mostly on arrays, sliding windows, 2 pointers, and stack, and only medium and easy questions. However, LeetCode did not help me in the interview at all.

## Next Questions

The next basic question was:

> How exactly does the internet work?

I gave my answer on DNS, CDNs, blah blah...

The next one was:

> How exactly does server troubleshooting happen? What are the different types of troubleshooting on the server side? What are the different problems occurring on the server?

I failed again.

## Last Question

The last question was:

> Explain a project from your master's days.

I thought I did well because Deep Learning is my interest, and I answered the question pretty decently. He asked a question, and I gave him the answer, but I think he got pissed off because I corrected him in some way.

## Conclusion

So this was my journey's head start. No jobs till now, no interviews till now. I stopped applying because my skills are not up to the mark, so let's learn and apply simultaneously. I have to think more positively.
